    <p>
        A link or hyperlink is a connection from one web resource to another. 
        Links allow users to move seamlessly from one page to another, on any 
        server anywhere in the world.

    </p>
   
    <p>
        A link has two ends, called anchors. The link starts at the source anchor and 
        points to the destination anchor, which may be any web resource, for example,
         an image, an audio or video clip, a PDF file, an HTML document or an element 
         within the document itself, and so on.

    <h3 id="mys">My Sql</h3>
    <p>
        MySQL (/ˌmaɪˌɛsˌkjuːˈɛl/)[5] is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).[5][6]
        Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter,[7] and "SQL", 
        the abbreviation for Structured Query Language. A relational database organizes data into one or more 
        data tables in which data types may be related to each other; these relations help structure the data. 
        SQL is a language programmers use to create, modify and extract data from the relational database, as 
        well as control user access to the database. In addition to relational databases and SQL, an RDBMS like 
        MySQL works with an operating system to implement a relational database in a computer's storage system, manages users, 
        allows for network access and facilitates testing database integrity and creation of backups.

    <h3 id="ms">MS-SQL</h3>
    <p>
        Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. 
        As a database server, it is a software product with the primary function of storing and retrieving data 
        as requested by other software applications—which may run either on the same computer or on another computer 
        across a network (including the Internet). Microsoft markets at least a dozen different editions of Microsoft 
        SQL Server, aimed at different audiences and for workloads ranging from small single-machine applications to large 
        Internet-facing applications with many concurrent users.
